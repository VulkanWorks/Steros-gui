# _Steros_, the new GUI library for C

If you are bored by the good old C GUI libraries then maybe its time for a change. 
Introducing Steros, a GUI library writen in C with the help of classic glfw (at 
some point it would be nice to remove this dependency) and all mighty vulkan API.

### Features:

- Powerful
- Fast
- Portable to other programing languages

### To be implemented

- Portability across operating systems and architectures (android, ios, wasm)
- The actual library
- CSS engine
- XML support

Because this library is free to use and has a very permissive licence, 
I would really appreciate (but its not mandatory) if you could link this reposotory in projects 
where you use it.
